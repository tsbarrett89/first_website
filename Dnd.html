  <p>There are two very distinct roles in Dungeons & Dragons, the Dungeon Master
   and the Player Character. When I first started playing I needed to fill the
   role of DM because no one else was willing. This posistion has afforded me
   the ability to create and direct, but I definetly prefer the role of PC.
   Recently I have been able to swith to the other side of the screen and I
   particularly enjoy playing alongside my wife.</p>
